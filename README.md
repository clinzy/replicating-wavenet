# Replicating WaveNet

I will be using this repository to attempt to replicate first the architecture and then the results of DeepMind's WaveNet in TensorFlow. Comment and contributions welcome.

There is an existing PixelRNN implementation in TensorFlow that I may try to leverage for this project once I have time to go through it. That implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/carpedm20/pixel-rnn-tensorflow).
